# Product Requirements Document: Job Search Consolidation Web App

## Introduction/Overview

The Job Search Consolidation Web App is a centralized platform that aggregates job listings from multiple job search platforms through email parsing, enabling job seekers to track and manage their applications in one unified dashboard.

2. Eliminate duplicate applications and missed opportunities through intelligent deduplication
3. Improve application-to-interview conversion rates by providing comprehensive tracking and status management
4. Achieve 50 active users with 10% (5 users) converting to premium within the first 3 months
5. Provide a delightful user experience that celebrates job search milestones
